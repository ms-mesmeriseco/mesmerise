      "We’ll present a concept and open up the floor for conversation. Taking an iterative approach, we move through creation, presentation, and feedback to get to the core of your brand. Typically, you’ll receive a style guide - the complexity of this depends on the complexity of your needs. We consider each element, from logo, to which fonts are ‘you’, and your brands chosen colour palette. This phase is usually constrained to a set number of feedback rounds.",

    question: "Isn’t branding just about a logo and some colours?",
    textContent:
      "A logo and colour palette are just the tip of the iceberg. <br/><br/>True branding is strategic; it defines how your business is positioned, how it communicates to your ideal client, and the impression it leaves behind. Your branding informs everything from your marketing to your customer experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "We already have a logo. What else is there?",
    textContent:
      "A logo is a starting point, not the whole picture. <br/><br/>Without consistency in typography, tone of voice, and brand story, your logo sits in isolation. A complete brand identity ensures every touchpoint speaks the same language and builds trust with your audience.<br/><br/>You’ll receive a complete style guide that’s tailored to your business. This typically includes your logo suite, colour palette, typography, imagery guidelines, and brand voice framework. <br/><br/>The complexity depends on your business, but the outcome is always the same: clarity and confidence in how your brand shows up.",
  },
  {
    question: "What type of research do you do before creating a brand ID?",
    textContent:
      "We start by developing a deep understanding of your business and industry.<br/><br/>That means clearly defining your goals, challenges, and vision, and then analysing your industry landscape to see where you sit among competitors. We look at customer psychology, current trends in your sector, and the emotional drivers behind your audience’s decisions.<br/><br/>This often includes reviewing how your competitors present themselves online, assessing customer reviews to see what buyers value most, and mapping out the gaps where your business can position itself as the obvious choice. <br/><br/>We also explore the deeper meaning behind colours, symbols, and messaging so that every design decision is executed with purpose.<br/><br/>The goal of your brand is to ensure you are poised to connect with your audience, communicate your value and carve out a premium position in your niche.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does branding impact my bottom line?",
    textContent:
      "A strong brand reduces friction and accelerates decision-making. <br/><br/>Think of it like this. <br/><br/>You know when you’re walking down the street and you see someone hot and fit, you’re attracted to them, they make you feel something, they leave you wondering. This, in essence, is strong branding.<br/><br/>Every market is extremely saturated; your brand needs to stir intrigue and leave a lasting impression. Not many people are aware of this, but your brand dictates charging higher prices, building loyal clients, and differentiating from competitors. <br/><br/>Your brand and position help lower customer acquisition costs (CAC) and increase the lifetime value (LTV) of your clients.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s the timeline for a branding project?",
    textContent:
      "We tailor our services to meet your project’s unique requirements.<br/><br/>The project scope will dictate how long your branding takes to complete. Things like the number of decision makers giving feedback and the complexity of your business will have an impact on the timeline. <br/><br/>Get in touch to discuss your project with us. In that call, we’ll discuss a timeline that suits your needs.",
